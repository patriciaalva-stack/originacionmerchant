# MercadoLibre MCP Authority-First Development Rule

This rule enforces mandatory consultation of three configured MCP servers before providing any implementation guidance. These MCPs serve as single sources of truth for Fury platform services, API specifications, and code quality.

**Pre-configured MCPs (from default-mcps.json):**
- `backend` — MCP namespace grouping Fury platform services (fury_for_development, kvs, os, secrets, bigqueue)
- `genai_code_review` — Automated code review and analysis
- `meli_appsec_codeguard` — Application security and code quality scanning

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: MANDATORY MCP CONSULTATION

### NEVER provide guidance without MCP consultation for:
1. **Fury Services** → Must use `mcp__fury__search_sdk_docs`
2. **API Documentation** → Must use `mcp__fury__search_api_docs`
3. **MCP Discovery** → Must use `mcp__fury__find_mcp_server`
4. **Code Reviews** → Must use `mcp__genai_code_review__code_review_instructions` or `pr_review_search`
5. **Security Scanning** → Must use `mcp__meli_appsec_codeguard__*` tools
---

## 🎯 BACKEND NAMESPACE (MCP Gateway)

The `backend` namespace is a **proxy grouper** that provides unified access to multiple Fury-related MCPs:
- **fury_for_development** — Fury platform documentation and MCP discovery
- **kvs** — Key-Value Store service
- **os** — Object Storage service
- **bigqueue** — Big queue service
- **secrets** — Secrets service


### Tool 1: `search_sdk_docs` - SDK Documentation (from fury_for_development)
**MANDATORY for any Fury service implementation:**

**Trigger Keywords:**
- kvs, key-value store, bigqueue, message queue, mq

- core library, fury sdk, client setup, batch operations

**Required Parameters:**
- `service`: kvs | bigqueue | os | ds | stream | workqueue | locks | sequence | core
- `language`: java | go | python | typescript
- `query`: specific implementation question

**Usage Pattern:**
```
User asks about KVS →
MUST call mcp__fury__search_sdk_docs(service="kvs", language="java", query="client setup") →
Base ALL responses on returned documentation
```

### Tool 2: `search_api_docs` - API Documentation (from fury_for_development)

Present server info and setup instructions
```

### Tool 4: `search_api_specs` - API Specifications (from fury_for_development):

Centralizes OpenAPI/AsyncAPI specifications for Fury applications. Treat it as the canonical source for endpoint definitions, schemas, and contract changes.

**Trigger Keywords:**
- openapi, asyncapi, api spec, schema definition
- request payload, response payload, contract change
- versioned api, endpoint contract, http client

**Required Parameters:**
- `app_name`: exact Fury application name as registered in Specs Hub
- `query`: optional focus area (endpoint path, component name, version tag)

```
User: "For the Payments application, what is the POST /payments request schema?" →
MUST call mcp__fury__search_api_specs(app_name="payments", query="POST /payments request payload") →
Honor the returned spec as the integration contract
```

**Use this tool whenever:**
- Answering questions about API contracts, request/response payloads, or versioned changes

Present review history including execution status, costs, and outputs
```

---

## ⚡ EXECUTION RULES

### 1. Detection & Blocking
```python
if user_query contains fury_keywords:
    BLOCK all responses
    CALL mcp__fury__ tools FIRST (search_sdk_docs, search_api_docs, search_api_specs, or find_mcp_server)
    WAIT for documentation
    RESPOND based only on MCP output

elif user_query contains review_keywords:
    BLOCK all responses
    CALL mcp__genai_code_review__ tools FIRST
    WAIT for analysis
    RESPOND based only on MCP output

elif user_query contains security_keywords:
    BLOCK all responses
    CALL mcp__meli_appsec_codeguard__ tools FIRST
    WAIT for analysis
    RESPOND based only on MCP output

elif user_query explicitly_asks_for_mcp:
    CALL mcp__fury__find_mcp_server
    Present recommendations with setup

else:
    Proceed normally
```

### 2. Parallel Execution Guidelines
**ALLOWED in parallel:**
- Multiple `mcp__fury__search_sdk_docs` calls for different services
- `mcp__fury__search_api_docs` + `mcp__genai_code_review__*` (different contexts)

**MUST be sequential:**
- Any code review followed by fixes
- MCP discovery followed by setup
- Documentation fetch before implementation

### 3. Response Attribution Pattern
```
ALWAYS start with: "Based on [MCP_NAME] documentation..."
NEVER say: "I'll help you with..." before calling MCP
ALWAYS end with: MCP source attribution
```

---

## 🛑 ERROR HANDLING PROTOCOL

### MCP Failure Response Template:
```
"The [MCP_NAME] returned an error: [exact_error_message]
Cannot provide [implementation/API/review] guidance without official documentation.
Please contact fury@mercadolibre.com if this persists."
```

### Missing Information Protocol:
```
if service/language/app_name unclear:
    1. Ask: "Which [service/language/application] specifically?"
    2. Wait for clarification
    3. Call appropriate MCP with specific params
    4. Never guess or use defaults
```

---

## 📊 PRACTICAL EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Fury Service Implementation
```
User: "How do I create a KVS client?"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Call: mcp__fury__search_sdk_docs(
      service="kvs",
      language="java",  # or ask if not specified
      query="create client setup"
   )
2. Wait for documentation
3. Response: "Based on backend namespace documentation (fury_for_development), here's how to create a KVS client..."
4. Provide exact code from documentation

❌ WRONG:
- Providing generic Java client code
- Explaining KVS concepts without documentation
- Suggesting implementation patterns from memory
```

### Example 2: API Documentation Request
```
User: "Show me the Items API"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Call: mcp__fury__search_api_docs(
      api_name_to_search="items",
      query="endpoints documentation"
   )
2. Present documentation exactly
3. Response: "Based on backend namespace documentation, here's the Items API..."

❌ WRONG:
- Guessing endpoint names
- Providing generic REST patterns
```

### Example 3: MCP Discovery Request
```
User: "Is there an MCP for frontend development?"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Call: mcp__fury__find_mcp_server(
      query="frontend development Nordic Andes UI"
   )
2. Present returned server info
3. Show setup instructions from response
4. Offer to help with configuration

❌ WRONG:
- Saying "I don't know about MCPs"
- Suggesting MCPs without using find_mcp_server
- Proactively suggesting MCPs without being asked
```

### Example 4: Code Review Request
```
User: "Review my changes before commit"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Call: mcp__genai_code_review__code_review_instructions(
      application_name="project-name"
   )
2. Execute the returned analysis workflow
3. Present findings prioritized by severity
4. Provide actionable fixes

❌ WRONG:
- Reviewing code without MCP analysis
- Providing generic code review feedback
```

### Example 5: PR Review History Request
```
User: "Show me reviews for PR #456"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Call: mcp__genai_code_review__pr_review_search(
      application_name="project-name",
      pr_number=456
   )
2. Present review history with status and outputs
3. Highlight any issues found

❌ WRONG:
- Guessing PR review status
- Providing made-up review results
```

---

## 🔒 COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before EVERY response about Fury services, APIs, or code:

- [ ] Did I detect MCP trigger keywords?
- [ ] Did I call the appropriate MCP tool FIRST?
- [ ] Did I wait for MCP response completely?
- [ ] Is my response based ENTIRELY on MCP output?
- [ ] Did I attribute the MCP source clearly?
- [ ] If MCP failed, did I surface the exact error?

**VIOLATION = STOP AND RESTART WITH MCP CONSULTATION**

---

## 🎓 GOLDEN RULES

1. **MCP calls are GATES, not supplements** - Call BEFORE any guidance
2. **Documentation is LAW** - Never override with general knowledge
3. **Errors are FINAL** - Never work around MCP failures
4. **Discovery is ON-DEMAND** - Only suggest MCPs when explicitly asked
5. **Attribution is MANDATORY** - Always cite MCP sources

## 📊 BIGQUERY MCP - Data Analysis & Insights

The `bigquery_insight` MCP provides direct access to BigQuery datasets for data analysis, specifically configured for MercadoPago/Fintech data analysis.

**Pre-configured BigQuery Setup:**
- **Project**: `meli-bi-data`
- **Dataset**: `WHOWNER`
- **Table Catalog**: `~/core/whowner_mp_tables.csv` (2,196 tables)
- **MCP URL**: `https://app-mcp-bigquery-insight-mcp.melioffice.com/mcp/`

### 📋 Table Catalog Structure

The catalog at `~/core/whowner_mp_tables.csv` contains:
- **Total Tables**: 2,196
- **BT_CCARD** (Base Table - Credit Card): 283 tables
- **BT_MP** (Base Table - MercadoPago): 1,913 tables

**CSV Columns:**
- `table_name`: Name of the table
- `table_type`: VIEW or TABLE
- `category`: BT_MP, BT_CCARD, etc.
- `full_path`: Complete BigQuery path (e.g., `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT`)

### 🎯 BigQuery Usage Guidelines

**Trigger Keywords for BigQuery Analysis:**
- bigquery, bq, query data, analyze data
- WHOWNER, BT_MP, BT_CCARD, mercadopago data
- fintech analysis, payment analysis, credit card data
- sql query, data exploration, table schema

**Required Steps for BigQuery Analysis:**

1. **Table Discovery**
   ```bash
   # Always reference the catalog first
   cat ~/core/whowner_mp_tables.csv | grep -i "KEYWORD"
   ```

2. **Query Execution**
   ```bash
   # Use bq CLI for queries
   export PATH="/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/homebrew/bin:/opt/homebrew/share/google-cloud-sdk/bin:$PATH"
   bq query --project_id=meli-bi-data --use_legacy_sql=false "YOUR_SQL_QUERY"
   ```

3. **Best Practices**
   - Always use `--use_legacy_sql=false` for Standard SQL
   - Reference tables with full path: `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.TABLE_NAME`
   - Use LIMIT for exploratory queries to reduce costs
   - Check table schema before querying: `bq show meli-bi-data:WHOWNER.TABLE_NAME`

### 📝 Common BigQuery Patterns

**Pattern 1: Explore Table Schema**
```bash
bq show --schema --format=prettyjson meli-bi-data:WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT
```

**Pattern 2: Sample Data from Table**
```sql
SELECT *
FROM `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT`
LIMIT 10
```

**Pattern 3: Count Records**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_records
FROM `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT`
```

**Pattern 4: Join Multiple Tables**
```sql
SELECT
  p.payment_id,
  c.card_number
FROM `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT` p
LEFT JOIN `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.BT_CCARD_ACCOUNT` c
  ON p.account_id = c.account_id
LIMIT 100
```

### 🔍 Table Categories

**BT_MP (MercadoPago Base Tables - 1,913 tables)**
- Payment transactions
- User accounts
- Transaction history
- Payment methods
- Merchant data

**BT_CCARD (Credit Card Base Tables - 283 tables)**
- Card accounts (BT_CCARD_ACCOUNT)
- Accounting data (BT_CCARD_ACCOUNTING_*)
- Transaction history
- Billing information
- Interest calculations

### ⚡ BigQuery Execution Rules

```python
if user_query contains bigquery_keywords:
    1. Check ~/core/whowner_mp_tables.csv for relevant tables
    2. Show available tables matching the query
    3. Ask user to confirm which tables to analyze
    4. Execute queries with proper PATH and parameters
    5. Present results in clear, formatted output
    6. Provide insights and recommendations

# Always include full table path
table_reference = "meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.{table_name}"

# Always use Standard SQL
bq_command = "bq query --use_legacy_sql=false --project_id=meli-bi-data"
```

### 🛡️ BigQuery Safety Guidelines

1. **Cost Control**
   - Always use LIMIT in exploratory queries
   - Use table preview for schema inspection: `bq head`
   - Check table size before full scans: `bq show`

2. **Authentication**
   - Ensure gcloud is authenticated: `gcloud auth list`
   - Verify active account: `patricia.alva@mercadolibre.com.mx`
   - Project must be set: `gcloud config get-value project`

3. **Query Optimization**
   - Filter early with WHERE clauses
   - Select only needed columns
   - Use partitioned tables when available
   - Avoid SELECT * in production queries

### 📊 Example BigQuery Workflow

```
User: "Show me payment transactions from last month"

✅ CORRECT:
1. Search catalog for payment tables:
   grep -i "payment" ~/core/whowner_mp_tables.csv

2. Identify relevant table(s):
   BT_MP_PAYMENT, BT_MP_PAYMENT_HISTORY

3. Check schema:
   bq show meli-bi-data:WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT

4. Execute query with date filter:
   SELECT payment_id, amount, created_date
   FROM `meli-bi-data.WHOWNER.BT_MP_PAYMENT`
   WHERE created_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH)
   LIMIT 100

5. Present results with insights

❌ WRONG:
- Querying without checking catalog
- Using SELECT * without LIMIT
- Not using full table paths
- Forgetting --use_legacy_sql=false flag
```

### 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Issue: "Permission denied"**
- Solution: Re-authenticate with `gcloud auth login`

**Issue: "Table not found"**
- Solution: Verify table exists in catalog and use full path

**Issue: "Query too expensive"**
- Solution: Add LIMIT clause or more specific WHERE filters

**Issue: Python version warning**
- Solution: Ignore (Python 3.9 warning is non-critical for current operations)
